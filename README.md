# Towers-of-Hanoi-solver.-
#After seeing the movie The Planet of Apes, I wanted to solve myself the Towers of Hanoi just like Cesar.  
# Tower of Hanoi solver showing the importance of recursion 
# A, B, C representing the three towers. 
# Assuming all discs are in A towers the code below gives 
#instructions to a robot to move disc from one tower to another. 
#m representing the number of discs in the intial tower (tower A)
#Feel free to participate a good idea would probably be trying to create a visualization interface to see the 
#discs moving in the tower
